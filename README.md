  <summary><strong>Assignment 1: State Wise Udyam Registration Analysis (R)</strong></summary>

### **Description**
This assignment focuses on analyzing the **State Wise Udyam Registration Details** dataset from the **Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME)** Udyam Registration platform. The analysis covers data processing, statistical analysis, and visualization.

### **Dataset**
The dataset includes six key fields:
- **Micro**
- **Small**
- **Medium**
- **Total Udyam**
- **IMEs (UAP)**
- **Total MSMEs**

ðŸ“Œ Dataset Links:
- [Udyam Registration Dashboard](https://dashboard.msme.gov.in/Udyam_Statewise.aspx)
- [Udyam Registration on Data.gov.in](https://www.data.gov.in/catalog/udyam-registration-msme-registration)

### **Features & Functionality**
âœ… **Data Import and Preprocessing**
- Reads the dataset from a CSV file.
- Displays raw data.
- Removes the last row (Total) to avoid skewing analysis.
- Converts numeric columns to integer format after removing commas.

âœ… **Descriptive Statistics Calculation**
- Computes **Mean, Median, Variance, and Standard Deviation** for numerical columns.
- Displays structured summary statistics.

âœ… **Correlation Analysis**
- Computes correlation between fields.
- Generates and prints a **Correlation Matrix** to understand interdependencies.

### **How to Run the Code**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```
1. Open **R environment** or **RStudio**.
2. Load the necessary package:
```r
library(dplyr)
```
3. Run the script in **R**.
